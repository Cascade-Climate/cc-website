# Cascade Climate Website

### For technical people:

This is a SvelteKit project with no extra libraries.
It is deployed on Vercel.

### For non-technical people:

This is a SvelteKit project. 
Don't worry if you don't know what that is, all of the code & content is written in plain HTML/CSS/Javascript, and there is plenty of documentation along with templates to copy/paste for adding new pages & content.

For any questions, concerns, or assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to <lee.matthew.j.2001@gmail.com>. I am more than happy to help with getting a local environment set up, or making any additions, adjustments, or fixes to the site.

##### Editing & previewing
If you want to edit files in your browser and deploy them live directly, you can simply add/edit the files on GitHub.

However, if you want to edit files on your computer & preview them before they go live, you'll need to download the files using [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and run them using [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can download the files to you computer using the following Git command from the command line:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cascade-Climate/cc-website.git
```

A folder should be downloaded called `cc-website` that contains the site files.
From here, you can navigate to this folder and build the project using the following npm commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```
