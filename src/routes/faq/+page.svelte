		<h3 id="description-header">What is Cascade Climate?</h3>
		<p>
			Cascade Climate is an independent, philanthropically funded NGO focused on dramatically
			accelerating progress across a range of open-system climate interventions (OSCI). OSCI are
			approaches that enhance or modulate natural systems already operating at planetary scale to
			mitigate climate change and its impacts.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2023, our focus is enhanced rock weathering (ERW) â€” specifically, the development of a
			healthy, thriving ERW market built on a foundation of robust science and rigorous measurement.
			We plan to expand our focus to include additional OSCI pathways in 2024 and beyond.
