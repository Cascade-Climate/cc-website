				<span class="long-button">Em breve: chamada para manifestações de interesse em português</span>

				<p class="intro-first">
					Cascade Climate is seeking expressions of interest from institutions to host and operate globally-coordinated enhanced rock weathering (ERW) research sites. We are standing up a global Coordinated Research Network (CRN) of standardized experimental field trials across diverse global geographies. We aim to establish up to 15 standardized sites, beginning with one or two pilot sites launching in 2026 with secured philanthropic funding for five years.</p>
				<p class="intro-second">
					By deploying standardized protocols, measurement strategies, and experimental designs, the CRN will achieve what isolated studies cannot: field-wide learning enabled by comparable datasets across global contexts. Host sites will receive operational funding, authorship opportunities on site-specific and network-wide publications, and access to a global community of ERW researchers.</p>

        <h1>The Challenge</h1>
        <p>Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy that involves the spreading of alkaline crushed rock feedstocks (including silicates, carbonates, or other alkaline materials) on agricultural soils. The quantification of carbon removal in an ERW deployment is complex, and involves a range of biogeochemical fluxes. A brief explainer on enhanced rock weathering can be found <a href="https://cascadeclimate.org/Cascade%20Climate_Enhanced%20Rock%20Weathering%20101_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Rigorous work across an expanding ecosystem of stakeholders and approaches is driving real progress on ERW. Yet there remains a need for coordinated research across a range of site characteristics with consistent, mutually comparable experimental designs and measurement strategies to efficiently answer the key questions faced by the field.</p>


    </section>

	<section id="the-objective">
        <h1>The Objective</h1>
        <p>The Coordinated Research Network (CRN) is our response to this challenge. It aims to establish up to 15 highly-standardized ERW field sites in sub-humid or wetter climates. We are targeting one or two sites for a 2026 deployment for which we have secured philanthropic funding to support over a five year period.</p>

        <p>The CRN intends to answer these questions:</p>
        <ol style="margin: 0;">
            <li>Across a range of soils and climates, what is the carbon removal potential of ERW and on what timescales? Field studies have produced divergent estimates<sup>1,2,3,4,7,8</sup>, and differences in measurement strategies, objectives, data reporting, and site conditions make it difficult to draw broad conclusions.</li>
            <li>How can different CDR quantification strategies (e.g., measuring changes in soil chemistry, measuring changes in porewater chemistry, using ion exchange resins) help us understand the full picture of feedstock weathering and transport of carbon? Deploying these methods side-by-side will help clarify the complexities of the weathering process and compare between different measurement methods.</li>
            <li>What are the agricultural benefits of ERW, and what factors drive them? Reported yield impacts<sup>1,5,6</sup> range from negligible to dramatic, but studies often lack proper controls or statistical power to isolate the mechanisms underpinning these effects.</li>
            <li>What happens to weathering products in deeper soils? Reactions below the commonly measured depths may reverse carbon removal, but these dynamics are difficult to observe and poorly represented in models.</li>
            <li>Across these sites, the network will attempt to reconcile different measurement strategies — solid phase, aqueous phase, and ion exchange resins — and to track the fate of cations in deeper (~1m) soils, where significant uncertainty remains. Agronomic parameters will also be measured on all sites in order to better understand what mechanisms lead to observed crop yield improvements. Measurements will also help to constrain the variability of key soil parameters to support the development, calibration, validation and intercomparison of geochemical models.</li>
        </ol>

            <div class="answer">
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                <li>Any person who has a field site that aligns with the site characteristics described in the <a href="/Cascade%20Climate_CRN_EOI_Site_Selection_Criteria.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Site Selection Criteria</a> should submit an EOI.</li>
                <li>See our <a href="/Cascade Climate_CRN_EOI_Conflict of Interest_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conflict of Interest Policy</a> for more information on who is eligible to host or manage a CRN site, including how ERW Project Developers can engage with the CRN.</li>
                <li><strong>Please submit one EOI form per specific site.</strong> If you have identified multiple potentially eligible sites, you are encouraged to submit multiple EOIs so you can share information on each site individually. </li>
                <li>We prefer submissions in English and welcome materials translated from other languages. </li>
                <li>The Site Selection Criteria distinguishes between required and preferred characteristics. Sites that meet the required criteria but lack some preferred criteria will still be considered. For example, if your site is not within the preferred pH range, you should still apply, as there are other factors (such as soil buffer capacity) that may allow a lower pH soil to be accommodated.
                </li>
                <li>For the initial pilot phase, we are prioritizing sites in areas that combine high weathering potential, benefits to farmers, and signals of commercial activity (e.g. Brazil, India, Kenya, countries in Southeast Asia, etc.). As the network scales, we anticipate expanding to additional geographies, and will use submissions to this EOI to also identify sites that may be a fit later in our process. 
				<li><strong>We encourage you to submit even if:</strong>
					<ul style="margin: 0;">
					<li>Your site doesn’t meet every <a href="/Cascade%20Climate_CRN_EOI_Site_Selection_Criteria.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preferred criterion</a></li>
					<li>Not all of the required roles are filled</li>
						<li>Launch may not be possible in 2026, since the network will scale over time</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
					<li><strong>If you are a researcher (PI) who is interested in engaging with the CRN, but do not have a site to propose for a field trial, please email us at grants@cascadeclimate.org.</strong> Include your name, institution/organization, public profile (professional webpage, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or similar), the specific geographies where you work, and a brief description of your interest in the CRN.</li>

                    <li>We plan to only share submitted information among Cascade Climate staff and academics who are members of our global Scientific Advisory Board and Working Group as needed for review. Information submitted will not be otherwise shared or circulated unless with prior permission by the Primary Contact indicated in the form submission.</li>
                    <li>EOI forms will be reviewed by the Cascade team throughout the month of March 2026.</li>
                    <li>Submissions that best match the Site Selection Criteria will be contacted to discuss next steps in April and May of 2026.</li>
                    <li>While we intend to explore partnerships with all sites that sufficiently meet the criteria, we will need to prioritize formalizing partnerships, developing budgets and pursuing contracting with 1–2 sites that demonstrate a realistic path to full launch before a Fall 2026 or Spring 2027 planting period. A full launch requires a contract in place, onboarded personnel, baseline soil sampling, instrumentation installations, and rock spread before a locally relevant planting season that will happen ideally by March 2027.</li>

                <li>This call for Expressions of Interest aims to select one to two CRN sites to support their deployment in 2026 – with philanthropic funding secured to fully support site operations for these sites over a five-year period.</li>
                <li>Cascade will continue to lead fundraising efforts to expand the CRN over time. We anticipate reaching out to additional site partners sourced via this EOI that may be suited to launch sites in 2027-2030 as the program grows toward 12–15 sites over the coming years. <strong>Therefore we encourage interested partners to submit an EOI for any potentially eligible trial site even if all partnerships are not yet in place.</strong></li>
                <li>Funding is intended to cover the costs of operating a CRN field site, including:
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                    <li>Personnel (including partial Principal Investigator time and a full-time Site Manager)</li>

                <li>CRN governance roles include:
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                    <li><strong>A Steering Committee</strong>, which has decision-making authority over funding and the annual operating plan of the CRN. </li>
                    <li><strong>A Science Advisory Board (SAB)</strong> of leading researchers that provides scientific oversight, reviewing objectives, experimental protocols, and site designs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Working Groups</strong> which bring together disciplinary experts to ensure standardization across sites and support experimental design and data analysis. Principal Investigators (PIs) of each site will also be members of the Working Group.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Local Operating Teams</strong> — typically a <strong>Principal Investigator (PI)</strong> and a dedicated <strong>Site Manager</strong> with associated <strong>Field and Lab Technicians</strong> — that execute the experiments at each field site with guidance from the Working Groups and SAB.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cascade Climate</strong>, which plans to provide coordination across global sites. This includes helping develop standardized protocols and training, data management infrastructure, and managing connections across these groups.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Cross-site collaboration is central to the CRN model and will include the following elements:
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                <li>Site PIs will participate in regular Working Group meetings, share experiences and lessons learned, and contribute to network-wide synthesis efforts. Working Group meetings will be conducted in English. We will address translation support as needed. </li>
                <li>The Science Advisory Board has final approval over experimental protocols to ensure scientific rigor and cross-site consistency. However, Local Operating Teams will have input throughout the process and can propose locally relevant questions within, or in addition to (budget permitting) the standardized framework.
                </li>
                <li>Local Operating Teams (particularly PIs and Site Managers) are expected to lead site-specific manuscript preparation and publication of results in collaboration with Working Group members, and must also agree to coordinate with the global Scientific Advisory Board for cross-site analysis. We anticipate opportunities for future joint publications from cross-site analyses. </li>

                <li>We expect all Site Host Institutions, PIs, and all other partners involved in data collection will review and sign off on data license agreements, which are required to receive funding. Data license agreements will elaborate on data sharing requirements with expectations such as the following:
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                    <li>Data will stream directly into a central repository accessible to Working Group and Scientific Advisory Board members for the purpose of supporting the coordinated nature of the research network.</li>
                    <li>Quality-controlled data will be made accessible to a community of academic geochemical modelers Cascade plans to convene as part of this initiative, for the purpose of calibrating and validating these models.</li>
