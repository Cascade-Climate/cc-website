				Since we released <a href="/blog/foundations-for-carbon-removal-quantification-in-erw-deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Foundations for Carbon Dioxide Removal Quantification in Enhanced Rock Weathering Deployments↗ </em></a>(“Foundations” for short), a question we often hear from the ERW community is: knowing the complexity, heterogeneity, and spatiotemporal scale of quantifying CDR in an ERW deployment, is it possible to develop rigorous methodologies that guide deployments today?
			</p>
			<p>The Cascade team believes the answer is yes.<em> </em>Rigorous measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) methodologies <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>can</strong></span> be developed for ERW, provided that:&nbsp;</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Methodologies are aligned with the current state of science and best practices&mdash;with <em>Foundations</em> offering a strong starting point;</li>
			<li>Methodologies require accounting for site specificities and variations across soil and hydrological systems; and</li>
			<li>A process exists to regularly update the methodologies as the state of science and best practices evolve.&nbsp;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The Cascade team also believes that rigorous MRV methodologies <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>must</strong></span> be developed for ERW. Commercial deployment is a productive avenue for learning, provided that project developers follow rigorous MRV methodologies and transparently share the learnings and data.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Commercial deployment can generate the rich datasets needed to advance our collective understanding of where and how to responsibly deploy ERW with optimal carbon and co-benefits. They can also advance learnings for the field on how to carry out MRV operations at a progressively larger scale, and act as the operational backbone for R&amp;D collaborations needed to tackle remaining scientific uncertainties. Without rigorous MRV, commercial deployments won&rsquo;t carry nearly the same value in responsibly scaling ERW.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Quantification complexity in and of itself should not be a barrier for investing in deployment. The primary challenge&mdash;and opportunity&mdash;is the collective willingness to fund direct measurements, and to ensure sharing of the collected data. We need catalytic buyers to pay for the needed rigor; credit issuers to develop stringent rulesets for the early market; governments to pioneer CDR policies that incentivize deployment-led learning; and practitioners and researchers working in concert to tackle the thornier quantification challenges.</p>
			<p>Cascade encourages the community to reference <em>Foundations</em>, among other resources, in the development of rigorous MRV methodologies now, and help chart a course for data sharing and data-informed improvement of ERW MRV over time.</p>
