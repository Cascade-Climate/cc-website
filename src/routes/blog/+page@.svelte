					ERW Metal Accumulation Calculator
				</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				As enhanced rock weathering gains momentum as a promising carbon removal approach, we need to ensure it remains environmentally sound. The ERW-MAC helps practitioners understand potential metal accumulation risks in soils from ERW deployments using intentionally conservative assumptions.

			<p>
				A question we often hear from the ERW community is: knowing the complexity, heterogeneity, and spatiotemporal scale of quantifying CDR in an ERW deployment, is it possible to develop rigorous methodologies that guide deployments today?
