				<h1>ERW MRV cost estimator and database</h1>
                <p>A key question surrounding enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is the quantification of carbon removal. To tackle that question, we worked with more than 100 ERW researchers and practitioners to develop <a href="/blog/foundations-for-carbon-removal-quantification-in-erw-deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Foundations for Carbon Dioxide Removal Quantification in Enhanced Rock Weathering Deployments↗</em></a>, a document that establishes best practices and core guidance for how to conduct carbon removal measurements and quantification in ERW deployments.</p>
                <p>In this piece, we break down the cost of deploying feedstock and carrying out these carbon removal measurements (particularly for those measurements in the upper soil regions where direct empirical measurements are required). We have collected over 1,000+ global, ERW-specific measurement cost estimates through compiling published quotes and sourcing quotes from quarries, academic and commercial laboratories, and ERW suppliers. These component-level quotes feed into a cost estimator that paints a comprehensive picture of the costs of sourcing, processing, hauling, and spreading feedstock, as well as the field sampling and laboratory analyses necessary for a small-scale deployment in the present day.</p>

			<h1>About</h1>
            <h3>0. About the ERW MRV Cost Estimator (EMCE):</h3>
            <p>As ERW continues to build momentum, practitioners need a common framework to rigorously quantify carbon removal. They also need tools and resources to better understand the cost implications of carrying out the measurements needed.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In response, we have developed and released a free-to-use cost estimator and accompanying cost database, collectively known as the ERW MRV Cost Estimator (or &ldquo;EMCE&rdquo; for short). The Cascade team hopes that the estimator and database can help practitioners of ERW deployments to build an informed picture of stacked costs when pursuing different measurement options in quantifying carbon removal.</p>
            <p><span>EMCE allows users to choose among common measurement techniques for understanding carbon and cation fluxes in an ERW deployment, adjust costs for each technique, and see how stacked costs could be influenced by different spatial and temporal densities of measurement sampling. While preset cost ranges are given for each measurement technique based on our compilation of quotes, the estimator is best used with user-inputted cost data. The final output? An <b>estimated</b> total cost of removing a tonne of carbon dioxide by ERW.</span></p>
            <p><span>From the onset, EMCE can (rightfully!) appear overwhelming. What follows provides a walkthrough of why, when, and how to use EMCE.</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Part 1 covers what EMCE is and is not; and what cost components are covered.</li>
            <li>Part 2 provides a tab-by-tab user manual and walkthrough.</li>
            <li>Part 3 provides background on how we sourced the quotes in the cost database.</li>
            <li>Part 4 is a call for practitioners to participate in total stacked cost case studies.</li>
            <li>Part 5 lists the authors, coders and collaborators behind EMCE.</li>
            <li>An Appendix is also included that provides a detailed glossary of every variable in EMCE.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Some knowledge on ERW and its quantification does make it easier to be oriented and feel situated in EMCE. If you are still relatively new to ERW quantification, we recommend reading the </span><a href="/blog/foundations-for-carbon-removal-quantification-in-erw-deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Technical Summary: Foundations for Carbon Dioxide Removal Quantification in ERW Deployments↗ </em></a><span> first.</span></p>

			<h1>What EMCE Is/Isn't</h1>
            <h3>1: What EMCE Is(n&rsquo;t) and What EMCE Does(n&rsquo;t) Cover</h3>
            <p><span>EMCE comprises two major cost buckets: Rock, Hauling, and Spreading (RHS) and Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV). EMCE offers a detailed and comprehensive MRV cost estimator module, and a comparatively much more basic RHS module. MRV and RHS costs are the two primary direct cost components for an ERW project developer.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>What EMCE doesn&rsquo;t cover are (a) capital expenditures associated with any equipment (e.g., spreader, storage shed, spectrometry equipment), (b) sales, general and administrative expenses, (c) any type of financing costs.</span></p>
            <p><span>EMCE is primarily designed for practitioners to estimate the RHS and MRV costs for small-scale deployments, using a suite of direct empirical measurements, and paying for laboratory analyses on an &ldquo;&agrave; la carte&rdquo; basis. It can certainly be used by practitioners who have access to volume-discounted pricing, although it&rsquo;s advised that, in these cases, users input their own component cost data.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>What EMCE is explicitly not:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>EMCE is explicitly not a tool to project the future trajectory of ERW MRV costs. How ERW MRV costs evolve over time depends on many factors: economies of scale, advances in landing on optimal quantification approaches, progressive shifts from measurement-heavy to model-heavy quantification schemes, etc. Many nonlinear developments could occur in the coming years that cannot be captured by EMCE in its current iteration.</span></li>
            <li><span>EMCE should not be used to design sampling and measurement plans. Robust quantification and sample planning requires a strong understanding of the characteristics of a given deployment site (e.g., soil biogeochemistry, underlying baseline variability of key parameters, site hydrology, and cropping systems). Once the MRV plan is created, practitioners can use EMCE to estimate stacked cost based on desired measurement techniques and the spatial and temporal densities of the measurements.</span></li>
            <li><span>We do not recommend that buyers use EMCE as their sole window in understanding the total $/tonne price of carbon removal via ERW deployments. In some areas, EMCE will produce an underestimate: for example, EMCE doesn&rsquo;t include business operating costs or profit margins. In other areas, EMCE will produce an overestimate: for example, EMCE&rsquo;s preset values won&rsquo;t take into account volume-based pricing, cost reductions from co-located or vertically integrated laboratory facilities, etc.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2: Tab by Tab User Manual and Walkthrough</h3>
            <h5>Field &amp; Plot Design</h5>
            <p>The &ldquo;Field &amp; Plot Design&rdquo; tab allows users to input basic information about the deployment size and subplot set-up.</p>
            <p>Under &ldquo;Field Design&rdquo;, users can input total hectarage, tonnes of rock deployed per hectare, total project period in years, potential CDR of the feedstock materials (the value is preset to represent typical mafic feedstock), and number of applications over the project period.</p>
            <p>Under &ldquo;Plot Design&rdquo;, users can divide the total deployment area into four sub-plots by applying a percentage of total field to each of the plot areas.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><span><strong>Treatment Plot</strong></span><span>: a less densely monitored area of the deployment where ERW treatment is applied (the value is preset to 90%).</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>Densely Monitored Plot</strong></span><span>: a more densely monitored area of the deployment where ERW treatment is applied (the value is preset to 5%).</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>Control Plot</strong></span><span>: a monitored area of the deployment corresponding to business-as-usual counterfactual or negative controls (the value is preset to 5%).</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>Research Plot</strong></span><span>: a densely monitored area used for advancing specific outstanding research priorities (the value is preset to 0%).</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users can choose to input different analytical techniques, cost ranges, time frequencies, sampling density, and sampling depth for the different types of plots described above.&nbsp;</p>
            <h5>Rock, Haul, and Spread</h5>
            <p><span>The &ldquo;Rock, Haul, Spread&rdquo; tab computes the cost of the raw feedstock, grinding and milling required to adjust the feedback to its desired grain size, transportation of the feedstock to the deployment site, and spreading the feedstock on soils. Within the transportation category, the tab allows users to choose a subset of long-haul, last-mile trucking, and terminal options, and adjust distances and cost ranges for each.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <h5>Feedstock Characterization</h5>
            <p><span>The &ldquo;Feedstock Characterization&rdquo; tab computes the cost of pre-deployment feedstock measurements, which are critical in understanding elemental composition and mineralogy of the feedstock, assessing theoretical maximum CDR potential, and evaluating heavy metal-associated ecological and human health risks. Users can adjust cost inputs associated with conducting measurements for the following feedstock properties:</span></p>

            </div>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Weathering Curve&nbsp;</h5>
            <p><span>In the &ldquo;Weathering Curve&rdquo; tab, users can adjust a logarithmic factor to generate a time-integrated estimate of feedstock weathering. This rudimentary simplification of how feedstock dissolves should only be used as a starting point.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>In the case that users have input 2 or above for the &ldquo;Numbers of Applications&rdquo; field in the &ldquo;Field &amp; Plot Design&rdquo; tab, the &ldquo;Weathering Curve&rdquo; tab will display the option to adjust the weathering factor for each of the applications independently. This is to reflect the fact that reapplication of feedstocks on the same field, especially multiple reapplications, will likely not have the same CDR efficiency as the prior application(s).</span></p>
            <p><span>In addition, when there are 2 or more applications, EMCE assumes that the first application takes place at </span><span><em>t</em></span><span> = 0, and any subsequent re-application is spread evenly across the project period (i.e.: specifying &ldquo;2&rdquo; under &ldquo;Number of Feedstock Applications&rdquo; when &ldquo;Project Period in Years&rdquo; is &ldquo;10&rdquo; would signify an application at </span><span><em>t</em></span><span> = 0 and </span><span><em>t</em></span><span> = 5.</span></p>
            <p><span>We want to be super clear that the &ldquo;Weathering Curve&rdquo; tab is used to generate a numerical &ldquo;Potential CDR&rdquo; estimate describing the release of base cations into solution upon feedstock dissolution over time. This is not netCDR. Users should account for the reduction in netCDR as a result of transient and permanent alkalinity sinks within the NFZ, carbon and cation losses in the FFZ, and upstream and ongoing life cycle emissions in the &ldquo;Losses &amp; Discounts&rdquo; tab.</span></p>
            <h5>Losses and Discounts&nbsp;</h5>
            <p><span>Users can input estimates of loss terms, as a percentage reduction of &ldquo;Potential CDR&rdquo;. These loss terms include the following. Section 8 of &ldquo;</span><a href="/blog/foundations-for-carbon-removal-quantification-in-erw-deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundations↗</a><span>&rdquo; provides an overview of the state of science and guidance for accounting these loss terms in near-term deployments. These loss terms include the following:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>Within the NFZ: pH/Non-Carbonic Acid Weathering, Cation Sorption, Secondary Carbonate Formation, Secondary Silicate Formation, Biomass Uptake of Base Cations&nbsp;</span></li>
            <li><span>Within the FFZ: netCDR loss in rivers and in oceans</span></li>
            <li><span>Upstream and ongoing lifecycle emissions</span></li>
            <li><span>NetCDR in counterfactual scenarios</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>These loss terms are additive, i.e. the percentages first are added together, and generated CDR in the deployment is reduced by the resulting sum.</span></p>
            <p><span>In addition, users can also input an uncertainty discount, capturing the statistical error of the end-to-end quantification. This percentage is deducted from the generated CDR after the above loss terms are first taken into account (i.e., if losses total 20%, and the uncertainty discount is 10%, netCDR will be (1-20%) x (1-10%) = 72% of potential CDR.)</span></p>
            <p><span>All of these loss and discount terms are user inputs and explicitly not computed from variables in other parts of the estimator.</span></p>
            <h5>Sidebar: Quick Overview of Near-Field Zone MRV</h5>
            <p><span>Before we deep-dive into the different tabs, it may be helpful to do a very quick recap of what we mean by Aqueous Phase Measurements and Solid Phase Measurements.</span></p>
            <p><span><strong>Aqueous Phase Measurements </strong></span><span> involve collecting and analyzing water samples, including soil porewater (via lysimeters), drainage waters, or water from downstream catchments. They can provide a direct measurement of dissolved weathering products as they are generated in, and exported from, the NFZ.</span></p>
            <p><span><strong>Solid Phase Measurements </strong></span><span> involve collecting and performing analyses on soil samples. In ERW deployments, CDR quantification can be performed by tracking cations released through feedstock dissolution in surface soils, with deductions then taken to account for the various carbon and cation loss pathways within the NFZ: pH/non-carbonic acid weathering, cation sorption, secondary mineral formation, and uptake of cations by biomass. Separately from the inorganic carbon fluxes, changes to soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks due to the ERW deployment can be tracked with solid-phase measurements as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <h5>Solid Phase Measurements&nbsp;</h5>
            <p><span>The Solid Phase Measurements tab computes the total stacked cost of an MRV plan using solid phase measurements.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Users can adjust the sampling and measurement plan&mdash;by choosing the frequency of sampling events, number of soil samples pooled for each analysis, which analytical techniques are used to measure different properties, and whether these analytical techniques are taken on shallow composite soil samples (&lt;~30 cm) or deeper composite soil samples (50-100 cm) or both. There are also options to input a cost range (including a &ldquo;low&rdquo; and &ldquo;high&rdquo; cost estimate) for taking soil samples and for each analytical technique, and to adjust the temporal and spatial density of samples taken.</span></p>
            <p><span>The following table steps through what each of the solid-phase analytical techniques measures and how these techniques map to the fluxes that need to be constrained in the NFZ.</span></p>

			<h1>Cost Database/CTA</h1>
            <h3>3: What is the cost database and how did we collect the cost information for it?</h3>
            <p><span>Certain low and high unit cost ranges are set as preset inputs in the web app. Presets are provided if a significant number of cost quotes have been collected for that particular analytical approach (refer to the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mWgcD9wqkQpAhdb79h4AymDnmuCPAPM_mQFrN60RC2o/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost database </a><span> for the full set of cost quotes). Low and high unit cost presets represent the low and high values amongst the collected cost quotes, after outliers are excluded.</span></p>
            <p><span>We gathered cost data through email inquiries, phone interviews, and web scraping in the process of building the cost database. We collected 100+ direct, non-public cost quotes from academic and commercial laboratories across three continents, and a further 1,000+ cost quotes from publicly available sources. We list the data source for all the quotes. This cost quote collection is still an ongoing process.</span></p>
            <p><span>One limitation of this approach is that the available quotes in the cost database tend to be &ldquo;&agrave; la carte&rdquo; pricing, and do not account for volume-based discounts, or cost reduction as a result of vertically integrating or co-locating analytical laboratories close to the deployment site. The effect of such cost optimization warrants further exploration.</span></p>
            <p><span>In order to produce more accurate cost information, we reached out to a cross-section of ERW project developers. However, at this time, given that the number of cost datasets obtained from project developers is still low, we have chosen not to publish any averaged or ranged data on measurement costs from ERW project developers.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>We invite more project developers to submit their cost information via </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnJOXOxRPMKUFO8YoORzMlZN4y8p9ZbECnbehm7avMdn_OPA/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this form</a><span>, and will seek to publish aggregate industry averages if and only if we are able to adequately protect confidentiality by gathering sufficient data for each analytical approach per geographic region.</span></p>
            <h3>4: Call to action: cost case study using a real-world MRV scenario</h3>
            <p>EMCE will be most useful when applied to real-world deployment scenarios, cost data, and sampling and measurement plans. It could be very valuable to use real-world data to paint a grounded and evidence-based picture about the current costs and future cost trajectories of ERW, and share this picture with policymakers, buyers and investors.</p>
            <p>We need collaboration from you to make that happen! If you are a practitioner conducting ERW deployments, and you are open about the idea of jointly publishing a total stacked cost case study with Cascade, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:emce@cascadeclimate.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emce@cascadeclimate.org</a>.</p>
