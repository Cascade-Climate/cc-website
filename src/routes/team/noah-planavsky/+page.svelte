			A Professor of Geochemistry in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Yale
			University and a Senior Contributing Scientist at Environmental Defense Fund. He obtained his
			Bachelor's from Lawrence University and his Ph.D. in Earth Sciences from the University of
			California, Riverside. He is a geochemist who uses empirical measurements and geochemical
			modeling to track the carbon cycle. He has a demonstrated track record of research at the
			forefront of understanding carbon dioxide regulation through weathering, the mechanics of
			enhanced weathering in natural and managed soils, and the downstream fate of captured carbon
			in natural systems. Planavsky also led the development of a cost-effective, time-integrated
			approach toward empirically tracking enhanced weathering rates in the field. He serves as a
			scientific advisor to a carbon verifier Verra and carbon platform Ceezer, and is on the
			steering committee at the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture.
