			An operator + investor in mission-driven businesses. He entered the climate world as an
			investor and advisor in 2021 after a career in education technology, most recently overseeing
			corporate VC and M&A at SEI, a publicly traded education conglomerate. Previously, he was a
			team leader at McKinsey’s NYC office; an operator at two VC-backed startups in NYC and SF;
			and, before graduate school, a public school teacher with Teach for America + the JET Program.
			In 2023, he returned to his hometown of Houston after 12 years in NYC. He holds a BA from Yale
			University and a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard’s Kennedy School. When not at work, you
			can find him home with his wife and two kids, paddleboarding down a river, or out
			photographing; his most recent longform project involved photographing the 44 communities at
			the final stops in the NYC subway system.
