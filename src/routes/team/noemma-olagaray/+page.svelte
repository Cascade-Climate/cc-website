			A researcher with a background in earth science and agriculture. She obtained a B.S. in Earth
			Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she studied paleoclimate and
			the climate’s impact on the natural environment. Most recently, she’s been working at the Yale
			Center for Natural Carbon Capture as part of a team developing and deploying pilot projects of
			enhanced rock weathering through funding from the USDA. She grew up on a farm in Northern
			California and is still involved in the operations of the farm today, even deploying an ERW
			trial on several acres of land there. When not working on solving climate problems, she can be
			found painting or in the great outdoors, surfing, hiking, or cycling.
