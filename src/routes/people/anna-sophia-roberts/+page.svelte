			A connector of people and ideas on a mission to make public policy work for the climate. Most recently, Anna Sophia coordinated an initiative at Meridian Institute integrating the latest climate science into select USDA conservation practice standards to enhance the climate benefit of conservation agriculture programs. She also supported projects aimed at conserving biodiversity using a variety of levers – from equipping investors to engage companies on nature action to informing international negotiations on biodiversity data. She holds a bachelor’s degree in biology from Carleton College, where she first became interested in the policy dimensions of carbon removal, carbon markets, the climate-agriculture nexus. In her free time, Anna Sophia enjoys running, biking, and hiking in the parks in and around Washington, DC (where she now calls home), and listening to an ever-expanding assortment of music.
