		<p>
			Antonius is the Executive Director of Carbon to Sea, the leading initiative to evaluate
			whether ocean alkalinity enhancement can safely remove and store billions of tons of CO2.
			Carbon to Sea spun out of Additional Ventures in 2022, where Antonius directed the ocean
			carbon dioxide removal program.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prior to Additional Ventures and Carbon to Sea, Antonius directed the ocean CDR work at CEA
			Consulting, advising foundations (such as ClimateWorks) on strategy and grantmaking in this
			field.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before entering the CDR universe, Antonius was a natural resource economist focused on
			fisheries and marine conservation in the tropics, as well as on climate smart agriculture.
			Antonius holds degrees in Biology (BSc.), Marine Ecology (MSc.) and Natural Resource Economics
			(PhD).
