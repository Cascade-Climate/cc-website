			<h2>Near-term Focus: Enhanced Rock Weathering</h2>
			<p>
				Our initial focus is advancing the development of a healthy market for enhanced rock
				weathering (ERW), underpinned by its scientific evidence base and its potential for
				gigaton-scale, durable carbon dioxide removal (CDR).
			</p>
			<p>
				As commercial activity in ERW ramps up, it is essential that we collectively steer toward a
				healthy, virtuous market cycle wherein large-scale deployments provide a powerful engine for
				public scientific learning along with declining uncertainties and costs. For open-system CDR
				to succeed, ERW needs to thrive—with rigor and quality at its core.
